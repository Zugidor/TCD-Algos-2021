# Vancouver Bus Management System
<p align=justify>
  This is our <strong>Algorithms and Data Structures II Group Project 2020/21</strong>, implementing a <strong>bus management system</strong>. For development purposes, the root of this repository is IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse IDE friendly (the associated files/folders are in the .gitignore) so feel free to keep your IntelliJ or Eclipse project in your local version of the repository. If IntelliJ or Eclipse create any extra project-specific files, please add them to the .gitignore file. However, for production purposes     <strong>do not</strong> run this application with the command line on Eclipse, as there are some <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=76936">Eclipse bugs</a> which do not render the progress bars in the application. We strongly recommend that you run this application from a <i>normal command line or with IntelliJ.</i>

## Group Housekeeping

For communication, we have a group discord server to discuss the project with each other. On a weekly basis, we update the files <a href="https://github.com/Zugidor/TCD-Algos-2021/blob/main/TODO.md">`TODO.md`</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Zugidor/TCD-Algos-2021/blob/main/Progress.md">`Progress.md`</a> to keep track of the work we need to do, and to also keep track of who did what. For more information on the contributions from each member of the team, please refer to [this page][Contributions].
