# Vancouver Bus Management System
This is our **Algorithms and Data Structures II Group Project 2020/21**, implementing a bus management system. For development purposes, the root of this repository is IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse IDE friendly (the associated files/folders are in the .gitignore) so feel free to keep your IntelliJ or Eclipse project in your local version of the repository. If IntelliJ or Eclipse create any extra project-specific files, add them to the .gitignore file. However, for production purposes `DO NOT` run this application with the command line on Eclipse, as there are some [Eclipse bugs][EclipseConsoleBug] which do not render the progress bars in the application. We recommend that you run this application from a normal command line or with IntelliJ.

## Group Housekeeping

On a weekly basis, we update the files <a href="https://github.com/Zugidor/TCD-Algos-2021/blob/main/TODO.md">`TODO.md`</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Zugidor/TCD-Algos-2021/blob/main/Progress.md">`Progress.md`</a> to keep track of the work we need to do, and to also keep track of who did what. We use a discord server to communicate, and we
